NEED ACTUAL RNG ENGINE

DELETING old deck when new deck is finished
-apparently .clear() doesnt work
-delete doesnt either?

fix how it registers blackjack
- line 225 + 252,
- 225 accounts for initial 2 cards being ace and 10
- 252 cannot use same method as there are too many cases
- 252 accounts for ace being 1, not 11 or 1

find a system for ace to be 1 or 11
- line 247
- line 223

delete previous player's cards/money/details

additional bonus gained from blackjack on initial draw

if all players bust, don't show dealer's hand and dealer does not draw more cards

when a player loses all his money, they get kicked
- need to change code so that once a player is gone, the code skips that player
